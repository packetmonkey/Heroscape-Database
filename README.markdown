HeroScape - The Data
====================

HeroScape is a great game, and unfortunatlly it has been cancled. In an
effort to preserve all the information about this game, I have started
to collect as much official HeroScape information as possible. 

This information is being collected in an open and portable format so
anyone can download and use the information how they see fit. Weither
it's putting up a cool online database or hacking on their own army
builder. This should make those effots a lot eaiser. Many databases
exist on the internet with this information, but they all seem to be
missing something. And none of them seem to allow downloading of the
back end data that powers the application. So here you go.

I should say I have no affiliation with Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast or
anyone else who worked on/for HeroScape during it's short time with us.
I'm just a (slightly obsessed) fan who loves portable data and has some
ideas on how to use it. Please fork and contrinbute any missing or
inaccurate information. Hopefully we can be the canonical source of all
raw heroscape data.
