A native of Valhalla, Raelin enjoyed a carefree and adventurous youth; then the war began, and her abiding friendship with Jandar bound her to his cause. To the relief of friendly forces, Raelin will often swoop into the the throes of battle and, striking the ground with her magical Spear of Gerda, engulf them in a shimmering blue force field. The warriors within this aura are instantly protected-even from Mimring's ferocious Line of Fire."

He learned to use them quickly, for Jandar's forces were already under attack. The Katana, an enchanted sword that channels the powers of the great warrior Thorian, obscures Alexander's image from afar, making him almost impossible to strike.

He thunders onto the battlefield atop his ferocious T-Rex, raising his spear triumphantly and daring his foes to outrun him or to take cover. Enemies who cannot do so may very likely meet either of two gruesome fates. Those who manage to evade the vicious jabbing of Grimnak's spear may face the T-Rex's deadly chomp. Many a warrior has been swallowed whole-or munched a morsel at a time-by this barbarous beast, while their comrades could only look on in terror and revulsion. Grimnak's fellow orc warriors are wise to travel with him when they can: during battle they are well protected by Grimnak and the T-Rex, and with the added security and confidence comes increased attack power."

With this extraordinary gift that is wasted on wickedness, Ne-Gok-Sa enslaves the minds of followers and foes alike.

But this defensive edge has its price: the weighty armor slows the Zettians down and affects their aim.

Her Spear of Gerda has become a famed weapon as its blue energies protect all those around her. With the certain knowledge that Raelin is guarding an ally’s back, friendly forces become better able to defend themselves, turning into killing machines as she protects their flank. Common troops flock to her side in support of her attacks, as her spirit and brave deeds are an inspiration to the allies surrounding her. Flying above the canopy of the Ticalla Jungle, she’s the perfect scout, ignoring the thick vines constantly pulling on the rest of Drake’s squad. Complex land features like jungles, swamps, and mountain ridges mean nothing to her. Her powerful wings carry her through the skies."
